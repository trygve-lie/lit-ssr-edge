ATTRIBUTION

This project is a port and adaptation of @lit-labs/ssr
(https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/ssr), which is part of the
Lit project maintained by Google LLC and licensed under the BSD 3-Clause
License. The following components are substantially derived from that work:

  - src/lib/render-value.js     — ported from @lit-labs/ssr/lib/render-value.js
  - src/lib/render-result.js    — ported from @lit-labs/ssr/lib/render-result.js
  - src/lib/render.js           — ported from @lit-labs/ssr/lib/render.js
  - src/lib/element-renderer.js — ported from @lit-labs/ssr/lib/element-renderer.js
  - src/lib/lit-element-renderer.js — ported from @lit-labs/ssr/lib/lit-element-renderer.js
  - src/lib/server-template.js  — ported from @lit-labs/ssr/lib/server-template.js
  - src/lib/reflected-attributes.js — ported from @lit-labs/ssr/lib/reflected-attributes.js
  - src/lib/util/escape-html.js — ported from @lit-labs/ssr/lib/util/escape-html.js

The key adaptation is replacing Node.js-specific APIs (stream.Readable,
node-fetch, vm) with Web Platform APIs (ReadableStream, fetch, TextEncoder) to
enable operation on WinterTC-compatible edge runtimes such as Cloudflare
Workers and Fastly Compute.
