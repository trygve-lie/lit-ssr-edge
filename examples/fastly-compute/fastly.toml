# Build pipeline:
#   1. esbuild bundles src/index.js (ESM) → dist/bundle.js (single file)
#   2. js-compute-runtime compiles dist/bundle.js → bin/main.wasm
build = "npm run build"

# Runs 'npm install' automatically after 'fastly compute init'.
post_init = "npm install"

[local_server]
# No [local_server.backends] section needed — this example serves pure SSR
# responses and does not make upstream origin requests.
#
# If your application fetches from a backend, add:
#   [local_server.backends.my_backend]
#   url = "https://api.example.com"
